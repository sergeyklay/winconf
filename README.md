# winconf

All my configuration files for Windows that I port around from system
to system with me. The purpose of this project is to organize my
PowerShell scripts and configs and sync them between machines.

## Shell support

These configuration files are meant to be used with PowerShell >= 7.0,
but some scripts may work with bundled PowerShell interpreter.
